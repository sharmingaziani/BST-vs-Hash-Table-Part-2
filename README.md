# BST-vs-Hash-Table-Part-2

Hey guys! Welcome to the second part of my java project for my Computer Science II class.

I took two routes to solve a problem to see which one was the most optimal in the end using...

Binary Search Tree
Hash Table
I read in a data file containing author names, book titles, keywords, and themes trying to find the most efficient way to organize all the data as well as search for it later on.

This repository is gonna explore using Hash Tables!
