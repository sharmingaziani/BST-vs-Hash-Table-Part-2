# Hash-Table

Welcome to my Hash Table project! 

I read in a data file containing author names, book titles, keywords, and themes trying to find the most efficient way to organize all the data as well as search for it later on.

The same one I used when I created my Binary Search Tree project (repository for BST: https://github.com/sharmingaziani/Binary-Search-Tree)

This allowed me to test which data structure was the most optimal for organizing and searching the user data with the given datafile.txt
